# Good Practice: INSPIRE download services based on OGC API - Features

This repository contains a specification for setting up INSPIRE download services based on the new [OGC API - Features standard](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/ogcapi-features).

A [specification document](/spec/oapif-inspire-download.md) has been developed by experts from DK, FI and JRC. It was submitted for review and testing to experts in the INSPIRE maintenance and implementation expert group (MIG) as well as solution providers who were already providing implementations of the standard. 

The specification has been endorsed as an [INSPIRE good practice document](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/portfolio/good-practice-library).

An overview of known deployments can be found on the [overview page of deployments](./deployments).

Please provide feedback and any issues encountered through the issue tracker.
