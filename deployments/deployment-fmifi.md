## 7. Issues

* The main issue is correct choice of the feature type (corresponding issue: https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-ogc-api-features/issues/51)
* Another issue is choice of encoding (corresponding issue: https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-ogc-api-features/issues/53). This is not a blocker issue but real interoperability requires harmonised encoding.
